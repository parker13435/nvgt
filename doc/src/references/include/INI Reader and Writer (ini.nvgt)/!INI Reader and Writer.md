# INI Reader and Writer
This is a class designed to read and write INI configuration files.

I can't promise that the specification will end up being followed to the letter, but I'll try. At this time, though the order of keys and sections will remain the same, the whitespace, comment, and line structure of an externally created ini file may not remain in tact if that file is updated and rewritten using this include.
