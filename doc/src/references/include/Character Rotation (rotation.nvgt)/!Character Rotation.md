# character rotation
This include contains functions for moving a rotating character in a 2D or 3D game.

## Disclaimer:
Though these have been improved over the years and though I do use this myself for Survive the Wild and my other games, it should be understood that I started writing this file in BGT when I was only 12 or 13 years old and it has only been getting improved as needed. The result is that anything from the math to the coding decisions may be less than perfect, putting it kindly. You have been warned!
