# Other
This directory contains any files that are in some way useful to anyone using NVGT, but which are otherwise unorganized, not very well documented, extremely miscellaneous/random, or any combination there of.

The following is a description of some, maybe not all, of the items in this directory.
* nvgt.evb is an old enigma virtual box project that someone can theoretically use to create a standalone executable of their project. It is a holdover from an older development environment and may or may not still work.
* classes and functions.txt are *OUT OF DATE* pseudocode referenfes of functions registered with the engine. Not everything here will still work, but some undocumented things are still here making these files potentially useful.
* pack_creator.nvgt is a useful utility that allows one to easily create pack files for distribution with their games with no hassle
* nvgt_string_aes.php are php functions that work the same way as nvgt's string_aes_encrypt/decrypt functions, meaning you can pass encrypted data either to php or NVGT and properly handle it on each end.
